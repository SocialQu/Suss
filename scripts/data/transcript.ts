export const transcript = `how lucky are we today 16 years
three pro bowls multiple awards
alex smith suddenly retired is our guest
now joining us live
we don't get many live guests since the
pandemic
and we've got uh alex smith today how
are you alex smith you look fantastic
thank you yeah thank you for having me
it is good to be in person live
rolling yeah good to be here and uh so
let's just talk first of all
joy and i had said this because we like
you and i said last year
okay alex smith was on television and i
had knots in my stomach
this is we said this we're like okay
this is hard
and i'm thinking you didn't you were
obviously but was there a
moment for you did you sense the anxiety
based on your comeback and the structure
of your leg did you sense there were a
lot of us going
all right slide alex throw it out of
bounds did you sense that
you know first off i i never fully
imagined or expected to be in that
situation you know i
honestly i think throughout the the
recovery i really thought
i'd never get there i thought i thought
the journey would end you know
the pursuit's great like but i'm not
actually going to get there it's just
it's impossible and you know i'm so
lucky you just kept going
and then those final steps though
absolutely were terrifying i mean to to
make the conscious decision
when i when i got when i got the
approval to play when i got the
the bill of health and it's like well
i'm gonna go step back out on a football
field
deliberately and when you play
quarterback it's not like a matter of
if i get tackled again i mean you're
going out there to play quarterback like
it's going to happen
and then the uniqueness of the year with
no preseason so i didn't get to do
any preseason to kind of test it right
uh in camp you wear a jersey
so you're you have this like cape of
invincibility out there you know like
you it's hard to know what's realistic
it always changes a little bit when you
get out there and the bullets are flying
so no doubt uh the combination of
exhilaration
and that feeling of being alive which is
what was part of the reason i
pursued this you know that to get back
to that but also the just sheer terror
you know to be out there i'm going back
out and my leg snapped the last time i
was out there like literally
and you know i'm running back out into
that environment so a little crazy
you know honestly um but an amazing
feeling
and and the best feeling of all is
obviously to get tackled and get back up
and know i was okay
um that that to conquer that mentally
you know the walls that i had built up
and really playing football again at the
nfl level to be the you know that for me
my everest
and and to go back and to do that and to
really have you know to deal with my own
kind of self-doubt
in that in that moment um it was amazing
to kind of push through
that and work through that um i love
sports
i admit um
the only thing i don't like about sports
is to see
players hurt so i have never watched
your video for the second time
uh the tim krumri video who joe
theismann
i refuse to watch it yeah i can't watch
the louisville basketball player
i can't watch it i just i it nothing is
sadder to me so your documentary
it's on the shelf and i keep thinking no
i don't want to watch it i i don't want
to go through that
i don't want to see him hurt you're a
family guy great family great kids great
wife
there had to have been a moment where
she's like honey
no like they're really really
deep conversations oh without a doubt re
really deep conversations about what
what do i really want what do we really
want and why
um i'm incredibly lucky because to be
honest when that conversation happened
and
you know for a long time football was a
thousand steps away it might as well
have been like going to mars
you know so sure like hey babe you're
doing great go go try
you know this is great and i and
obviously that was amazing that
the real gut check came in those last
moments
when i got when i got cleared to play
which i never thought i would get where
were you oh we had just gotten back this
is
in the midst of kovid you know there was
no off season so i'd been away still
kind of just doing my rehab on my own
quietly no one expected me
i hadn't had any imaging done in a long
time on my leg we didn't know where i
was at from a healing process my bone
and and i go back this is on the
doorstep of camp
you know a couple weeks before training
camp we go back to dc
and i get a bunch of imaging done and
i'm really kind of expecting
it had kind of been not great news all
along with my with my actual
my tibia healing and i'm expecting to
hear
you know you just it's not in the cards
it's over and
um you know i expected to walk into that
and then i hear the news it's the exact
opposite they're
incomplete the team of surgeons and
doctors
all were in agreement that i could go
play that i could do anything and i'd
never heard those words that like i
clean bail health you can go do whatever
you want from from a health standpoint
and i'm like
i can go i can go ski snowboard and
they're like yeah like i can go mountain
bike
yeah i'm not trying to think of these
crazy things because for two years i'd
walk around on eggshells
you know trying not to even slip and
fall in the kitchen or getting you know
out of the shower
and all of a sudden i'm like well i can
play tackle football and they're like
yeah you want to play you can play wow
so leaving that meeting
you know my wife and i we're sitting in
there and we go sit in the car and
i mean yeah one of the most intimate
conversations i've ever had
with my wife here and i'm and i'm
i'm i'm so excited i can't get the grin
on my face because i've got this
clean belt help that i never thought i'd
get again at the same time i'm terrified
because the football is right there i
mean it's right that line's right there
and there's the next step and i i just
got the green light to take that step
and i'm i'm really scared and i really
want my wife to tell me what you just
said
you know what babe life is good we're so
lucky to be back here we got our
we got your health back kids are great
like let's let's just get on with our
life and be done
and for me my mind you my wife helped
nurse me back to health
the number of hats she wore over this
two-year process
uh is crazy and then in that moment for
her to have the strength
to give me the nudge i needed it's like
no babe i
i think you need to do this i think for
you i think you're gonna have regret if
you don't see this through
you know for two years you've been
working your tail off to get to this
position and
we're so lucky to be here now and i
think you gotta go do this
and meanwhile i'm hoping she tells me
let's go let's be done retired you know
like so
uh but i needed that i needed that nudge
so lucky that my wife to have that kind
of strength i'm not sure i could have
done it if the roles were reversed
um so thankful for her to kind of give
me that push and
you know there's been people throughout
my recovery process that have helped me
with that that kind of continued to keep
pushing me when i needed it
all the awards you've won multiple pro
bowls what did comeback player of the
year award mean
um yeah i mean i think the award was
special
it's not something i set out to do again
i never thought it was realistic i never
i never thought i'd actually get make it
back out on the field what did players
say to you during the season
you know it was so it was so weird a ton
of support it was covered so there's no
fans so going back to when i played
there was
there was no like heightened energy
there were no fans in any of the
stadiums right especially at home games
um so it was always a little different
from a from an energy standpoint but
i it definitely was it was amazing to to
get a lot of the love from
you know even the opposing teams when i
did get to visit with them obviously
over 16 years you accumulate a lot of
friends
across the league and then my own
teammates you know
they were so amazing throughout that
process supporting me
and all the steps you know from my first
my first practice rep
you know then like the game when i first
got the dress and all the way to
you know obviously getting to start six
games um
you know my teammates there to be with
me and to really kind of
uh to be that energy for me and you know
support me along the way was was
it was amazing and that's also you know
the big reason you come back for that
camaraderie you just can't get that you
can't get that bond
anywhere else and so for me it was
really special and and obviously the
entire year to get
to get all of that back and something i
never thought i could
do again uh alex smith joining us for
our radio audience
so a couple of questions here you've had
so many connections
through the years let's start with this
one this will be a fun one we both know
urban meyer you know him really well i
know him pretty well
um what's going to be the hardest part
of college to pro
he was your college coach yeah i mean i
think
a couple things the big ones getting
everybody buy in
you know you go from dealing with 18 to
20 year old kids
who in in in college football your urban
meyer
you're this you know big persona um
you know and really you got a lot of
control over these kids and they're at a
pivotal age
and and really you can really kind of
dictate a lot about these kids buying in
and being a part of the program or
go packing you know um
it's not like that the nfl you know like
no that guy's signed on for five years
so 140 you know hey that guy's 33
grown you know 12 year vet with three
kids like
you are going to handle guys differently
i think urban i don't think that's going
to be a problem for urban i think
i think he spent a lot of time studying
this i even think his progression
as a college coach you know utah to
florida and then retiring and going to
ohio state i mean
that was a quasi minor league team
anyway right um so i think he's dealt
with those personalities and i think
he'll be fine with that
i think guys want to buy in you know
it's jacksonville they were 1 in 15.
guys want guys want to win they want to
be a part of the change
right it's going to be able to get that
momentum going and the proof's in the
pudding i mean you got to get you got to
start winning games and
and and build it and that's how you keep
guys on board
um you know and then a little transition
and this is less so i think this has to
do with the timing is the game has
changed at the nfl level from a nexus
and no standpoint
when i got drafted i was it was a
gimmicky college offense that i ran
give me a shotgun i was in the shotgun
every play we were running the spread
option
i'm reading a defensive end on a run
play that can't be done in the nfl that
was a question about yeah like i got to
be a pro-style quarterback
i mean now it's like let's go i mean
what team's not doing that
what team isn't living in the shotgun um
obviously the timing to get trevor
lawrence i think uh you know
about as bona fide of a prospect as you
can get
um i think all that said i think that's
all stuff that i think urban's got on
his side
so i'm excited for him he's got i've had
a chance to visit with him here
you know since he took the job and and
he's got so much energy i think he's got
a plan laid out i think he's been
thinking about this for a long time
he's not a not a guy that makes rash
decisions he's incredibly smart
incredibly thoughtful i'm i'm so excited
to see
what he's going to do that was probably
the hardest part with me stepping away
potentially was
you know that excited me to potentially
go down there and be a part of that
um you know but i i'm excited to watch
uh what happens i think he i think he's
got a great plan and a good shot at it
he's the best
offensive coach in college football
history in my opinion
the most creative then you go to the nfl
with andy reid
who is to me the best play designer in
league history
um give me the moment the epiphany the
car
ride the connection to andy reid and
you're like
oh so this is what it's all about this
guy really is different as an offensive
coach yeah
there were probably a couple times you
know forever from the outside i'm like
oh he's this traditional west coast
offense you know he runs the west coast
and i've been in the west coast before
i've gotten andy
and a lot of times it's very stringent
like here's your playbook this is what
we're running
right and we're trying to get players to
match this playbook
you know like it got formed obviously in
the niner days we need a guy to play z
like jerry rice and we need a guy to
play x
like john taylor and you know like we've
got to get the pieces to fit into this
playbook because
this is what we're running and we've
been running it for 20 plus years you
know it works
and you get there with with andy
and he i mean obviously he knows his
ball but yeah we're running
these core west coast principles but i
mean we're doing them all over the place
and shifts in motions and he's
he is fearless in constantly evolving
and for me that was like a huge wake-up
call like this i mean i know we're
saying this is west coast we're not i'm
in a shotgun we got a fly sweep guy we
got
you know tyra kills running this and
kelsey's running this and
how much fun that was you know and i
think how much
coach loves teaching like at his core
he's a teacher yes he is
and and he loves that and i know that
was a big thing obviously as he came
from philly
you know wearing kind of multiple hats
as a gm and doing the roster stuff
really
stepping away from that because he
wanted to get back to teaching you know
and
and to hear my first install when when
coach reed does the install he's a head
coach he's installing the plays in front
of the entire offense
and this guy can coach the left tackle
the center the quarterback
the running back the stance and route
running of the receivers i mean there's
not a position on offense
that coach reid can't coach and knows
his stuff about the fundamentals
the things that actually make a
difference you know and for me
forever as a quarterback if you throw a
ball high of course you're gonna hear
hey you gotta get it down
you know and i'm like well i'm gonna hit
quarterback like of course i know i
gotta get it down
you know you throw it out in front you
gotta put it on him yeah thanks
you know like i knew that already coach
reed is one of the first guys to
constantly be like well
well why was that ball high you know hey
maybe you were you were a little too
spread apart right here with your legs
let's be getting back into an athletic
position teaching constantly like well
helping me
helping me get the ball down you know
like not just stating the obvious so
uh that's what i loved about him and he
loves ball i mean that's contagious when
you're when you're head coach just loves
football he loves coming to work
he loves being around the guys um that
that feeds out throughout the throughout
the building
so alex smith joining us if you're
listening on radio what a pleasure for
us we could take you for
next four hours we should just cancel
the rest of the programming today i'll
just talk to alex smith
so um you know we've been talking about
the jordan love situation there was a
pandemic no preseason i have no idea
what he looks like
but i do believe that if somebody is
special you see glimpses of it so
peter schrager had told me a year and a
half
mahomes was like in camp
like the first ota and he's like i'm
hearing stuff about mahomes
and i'm like well he better be pretty
good because alex smith has made the
playoffs
so go back to the first couple practices
with mahomes did you see
the magic oh without a doubt that year
you knew
you knew he could play football i think
again going back it's hard as a
quarterback when you got the jersey on
um ending your practice and you're
untouchable
to really kind of fully see how that
translates to the field especially with
patrick who
a lot of the play a lot of the magic
happens
and he's so good at it has such great
instincts so you could see that on the
field
and then he saw the confidence i think
for me i remember like midway through
the year
and we would compete at everything like
quarterbacks it was it was a fun
fun time there coach nagy was still
there and we're rolling we would compete
hard
you know we'd be doing individual
drilling just you know it was like who
could be who over there and
i remember you know he's he jumps in for
some reps
running scout team against our defense
we had a good defense at the time and
like remember the first couple times he
starts whipping around
no look passes and you're like that's
not that's not normal
you know like just from a confidence
standpoint like who has the confidence
to just like
whipping in no look slants like the only
guy i've ever seen that's brett favre
ever do something like that and
really then you know that that final
game week 17 to watch him
you know we had clinched and we couldn't
we couldn't do any better so i wasn't
playing and he got he got to go out and
play
and to see it live in action i mean it
was like yeah this kid's got it
because i don't care what your physical
tools are at the nfl level
and obviously those are special but you
you got to have you got to have it up
here you got to be able to process fast
you got to be able to play fast
and and really it's a mental game at the
nfl level
and and patrick had it and you know and
that was clear i think
throughout the season his work habits he
could process information
and then you know you you obviously pair
that with like a crazy
skill set and he's you know this is what
we've gotten the guy that
i really think one of the unique players
in nfl history especially
today you know winning the mvp that
early on and a super bowl so
uh fun it's fun to watch i mean for me
just to have like a little sliver to
have been there with it with him in his
rookie year
it's fun i'm such a big fat fan of
patrick's and also just because of the
person he is he's such a great dude i
mean especially in the face of this kind
of
limelight um and stardom to have
maintained
the good person that he is is is even
you know i think makes it more special
final question how surprised are you
how ugly aaron rodgers and the packers
has become
it's inexcusable it's absolutely in it
i think what do you mean how they ever
got to this point
i mean aaron's been there 16 years what
he's given to that organization and been
there
and for them i think to what happened
last year during the draft and
and i'm going to talk to aaron about
this so i don't want to like put words
in his mouth but clearly to watch the
interview and him talk about it's about
the people
and it is and aaron's been there that
long and i don't think it was the fact
that they drafted jordan love in the
first round
i mean i think the fact that you just
how do you have a guy like aaron and you
don't go make sure beforehand you aren't
going out of your way to make sure that
he knows
that he's loved that they want him there
that we may be taking a quarterback in
the first round we want to make sure
you're okay with it this is maybe what
we're doing we're thinking
i mean how you haven't treated him the
right way
leading up to that and the fact that
from my understanding it's kind of like
it was a bit of an unknown a bit
blindsided
you go from potentially thinking you may
be taking a receiver you know you're
you're thinking you're a move away from
the super bowl right
and then blindsided with a pick i just
don't understand how an organization
he how is he you have how you haven't
addressed that beforehand when you make
a move like that
and really made sure that everything is
is tightened up
and everybody's feeling good about that
because if it's not you're not doing it
in my opinion you're just not it's just
not the way you you run
a business it's not the way you're
treating people um
16 years this guy's been there you're on
the doorstep of the the super bowl
and you don't go out of your way to
communicate that and to show that he's
you know that hey you're wanted
this may be something we're doing sorry
and you know but like you don't make
sure that everybody's on the same page
and feeling good about that i think
you know it's not just football that's
any business or team yeah
did kansas city give you a heads up on
the homes yes without a doubt
with a hundred percent i mean that's
something that was talked about
throughout the draft process not just by
coach reed um
everybody involved in the personnel
apartment yeah without and i mean
and i'm talking multiple times hey this
really might be something we're doing
are you okay with it this is going to be
the situation
this is i mean you know like there were
no surprises
i mean it was it was absolutely laid out
for me um
and and i think that all helps you know
that when that stuff's communicated
um it does make a difference how you
treat people yeah
hey what a pleasure to have you today
yeah thanks for having me it's good to
be here
it feels so lucky to have you you've
been such a credit to the league
