AI transcription &amp; summarization service for videoconferences 🐕‍🦺

## Motivation

It is not uncommon for employees to spend 20% of their time in meetings.

Documenting a meeting in a minute or memo is a valuable resource to reference what was talked about and agreed, provide a good starting point for future meetings and assess its productivity.

However, there are several inconveniences to delegate the responsibility of documenting a meeting's minutes 📃 to employees. This includes the unaffordable, cost of dedicating a single person to the task, the lack of active participation for the person taking notes, and/or the subjective outcome based on various personal agendas.

Recent advances in Deep Learning and web browsers 🕸️ make it possible to automate the task of transcribing and summarizing a meeting to an AI agent.
