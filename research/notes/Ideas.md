  * What was the meeting purpose?
  * What were the top 4 - 5 topics covered?
  * What are relevant notes from the meeting?
  * What conclusions were reached?

2. Train an autoencoder to reconstruct the meeting.

3. Use the transposed matrix to apply PCA recursively and select the sentences that reflect the meaning the closest meaning.

4. Build a custom dataset from YT. Use title & description to train a Neural Network.

5. Find the salience score of each sentence word. Attempt the same with paragraphs to sentences 📤. Select the sentences with most salience.
