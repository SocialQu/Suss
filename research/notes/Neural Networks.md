# Neural Networks 🧠

Use a supervised dataset to train which sentences are to be included.

Divide the text in 40-sentences pages.

Recursively select the sentences that should be included in the summary.


## CNNs

The CNN model is applied to learn the feature vector for each sentence and assign a salience score to it.
